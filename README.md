CENG487 Introduction to Computer Graphics Class Repo

- Notes:
	- On Windows install PyOpenGL and PyOpenGL-accelerate by downlading packages from:
		http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs
	and installing them as:
		pip install [package-name].
	This is needed as official pip repo does not have glut in it.

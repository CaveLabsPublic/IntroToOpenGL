IYTE CENG487 Introduction to Computer Graphics Class Repo

- Notes:
	As we talked we will be using Python as our development environment. Please download below packages and install them:

	- Python3.10.11
		Windows x64 -> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11.exe
		Linux: sudo apt-get install python3.10.11
			Linux: sudo apt-get install python-pip
			Linux: sudo apt-get install python-opengl
	- Once that is done you can use pip which is python package installer on windows and linux to install these other packages:
		pip install numpy version 1.26.4
			make sure you use version 1.xx.x as version 2.x brought incompatibility with other packages
		pip install PyOpenGL version 3.1.9
		pip install PyOpenGL-accelerate version 3.1.9
	- On windows as part of the installation process choose to add the python to the path. This way you can run python stuff directly from WindowsPowerShell or cmd. I use WindowsPowerShell , it is a pretty good shell. On Linux use your favorite shell of choice.
	- To test the installation, clone the class repo from github and run:
		python 01-HelloOpenGL.py
	- We will be using GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit for windows, mouse support etc.
